</abstract>
			<purpose>
To show areas with different average elevation levels of Bangladesh. The

All the attributes other than standard Arc/Info attributes are of
character type.
- Attribute item "elev_m" was abstracted from insert on geologic map
denoting average elevation level.
- Standard verification of attribute reliability was performed by
comparison with original insert.
- Plots were created of the coverage, colored and labeled by item "elev_m"
at the same scale, projection and map extent of the source maps for the
purposes of review and examination. Review was conducted by persons
uninvolved in the compilation.
</attraccr>

Has been made by comparison with original

This map was compiled from the small scale (1: 5,000,000) insert Md.
Khurshid Alam, A.K.M.Shahidul Hasan, and Mujibur Rahman Khan (Geological
Survey of Bangladesh), and John W. Whitney (United States Geological
Survey), 1990, Geological Map of Bangladesh: Geological Survey of Bangladesh
Publication,  scale 1:1,000,000.
1. Original insert was scanned on large format scanner in gray-scale mode
with resolution 200 dpi.
2. The scanned image was transformed to Lambert Conformal projection by
ArcInfo REGISTER and RECTIFY utilities.
3. Reference data for transformation were Bangladesh state boundaries taken
from paper map and compared with the same boundaries on master geological
map. Overall RMS error of transformation was 1500 m (0.3 mm on original
paper map).
4. On-screen digitization was performed using a rectified image as a
backdrop in ArcInfo ARCEDIT.
5. Elevation values in meters were assigned to "elev_m" item of Feature
Attribute Table (FAT) of "elev_g" coverage.
6. ArcInfo coverage was converted into .E00 files, then imported to ArcView
by IMPORT 71 utility and saved as shape files.

1. Original map is of 500 m. maximum accuracy (0.1 mm on paper map
insert of 1:5,000,000 scale).
2. Scanned images are of 200 dot/inch resolution (0.1 mm on paper).
Therefore fuzzy tolerance in ARC/INFO was set to 750 meters (three
pixels).
3. Several steps were taken to vectorize scanned images as follows:
3.1. Country coverage "cntry95" was used as a reference for ArcInfo
REGISTER and RECTIFY programs. Overall RMS error was 1500m. The
vectorized coverage was edited and attributed in Arcedit using the
gray-scale image of the source map as a background guide.
3.2. Line attributing of the ARC/INFO coverage was verified and
corrected by comparing it with the gray-scale image as a background.
ESRI's ArcWorld 1:3M data set is too small in scale for position
accuracy estimation since original map was at 1: 1,000,000 scale, but to
estimate relative positional accuracy such a comparison has been
performed. Overall relative position error was estimated by randomly
selecting set of locations on the ESRI World country coverage and
comparing it with the state boundaries on the final geology coverage
(b_geo). RMS error is 2.9 km (0.58 mm of the original paper map).
